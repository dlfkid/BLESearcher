# UIExtensionKit
 Every developer has used such tools to build UI. But neither I don't want to write them every time I start a project nor I want to use other's frame work - which usually loaded with some other stuff and not showing what they are unless you look deeply into the header files, so this is it, pure and simple.

# Description

All method are implement as categories, So it's easy to call on use, just remember to import them first, I recommend importing them in your base VC or views, so all the subclasses can save the trouble.
